<p class="pcenter"> - First step into getting an IQ like LeBron James is to study the rule book for basketball so you know every rule and updated ones.</p>
	
<p class="pcenter">- The next step is to study the opponent you face.</p>
	
<p class="pcenter">- Find your opponent’s strengths and weakness so it is easier to play against them.</p>
	
<p class="pcenter">- Lastly is to have very good decision making, whether it is to set up a play to score or to stop the opposing team from scoring.</p>
	
<p class="pcenter">- Studying the game, teams and players like homework from school, is what you need to do, to have a high IQ like Lebron James.</p>
	
<p class="pcenter">- LeBron calculates everything he does. Before he assists a teammate, attacks the basket, or shoots a jumper, he analyses to see which will be the most effective and efficient or which will expose his opponent’s defence. </p>
